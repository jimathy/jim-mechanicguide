------------------
## Performance Items

- These all work very similarly
- Stand next to the vehicle and use these items.
	- If the upgrade can not be put on the car, you will get a notification telling you so.
	- If it can, you will begin adding it to the vehicle.
- If you have an upgraded part already in the vehicle, adding a different level item will remove the previous upgrade from the car and place it in your inventory.
- The mechanic's `toolbox` item is used to remove these upgrades and set them back to stock.
- The items classed as performance items include:
```
- car_armor - "Vehicle Armor"
- brakes1 - "Tier 1 Brakes"
- brakes2 - "Tier 2 Brakes"
- brakes3 - "Tier 3 Brakes"

- drifttires - "Drift Tires"
- bprooftires - "Bulletproof Tires"
- turbo - "Supercharger Turbo"
- headlights - "Xenon Headlights"
```
------------------
## Cosmetic Items

- These all work very similarly
- Stand next to or get in the vehicle and use these items, if options are available for the car this will bring up a menu that shows a list of possible cosmetics
- To reset back to default, use another of the same item, as you are putting the "stock" on
- The items classed as costmetic items include:
```
- bumper - "Vehicle Bumper"
- exhaust - "Vehicle Exhaust"
- externals - "Exterior Cosmetics"
- hood - "Vehicle Hood"
- horn - "Custom Vehicle Horn"
- internals - "Internal Cosmetics"

```

------------------
## Mechanic Items

- This is the list of rest of the items that come with this script
```
- toolbox - "Toolbox" - This is the scripts main way to control the performance modifications in a car.
- mechanic_tools - "Mechanic tools" - This is the script's main repair tools
- nos - "NOS Bottle" - My scripts Nitrous Canister
- noscan - "Empty NOS Bottle" - Empty Nitrous Canister
- ducttape - "Duct Tape" - A configurable repair item
- mechboard - "Mechanic Sheet" - Given as a list of changes when completing a preview of the vehicle
- underglow_controller - "Neon Controller"-  Controls underglow style and colour + xenon headlight colours
- sparetire - For repairing wheels while in the toolbox menu
- sparkplugs - For repairs
- carbattery - For repairs
- axleparts - For repairs
- newoil - For repairs
```

------------------
## Toolbox / Check_tunes.lua

- This is all about the item "toolbox" this item
- The toolbox is only usable by mechanics, if `Config.RequiresJob` is enabled
- This item can only be used **OUTSIDE** of a vehicle.
- This displays information about the vehicle's currently installed peformance modifications
	- It will attempt to grab information from qb-core's `vehicles.lua` to display vehicle names and the value, it does this by searching for a matching "model hash".
	- It will list the names and levels of each installed modification, and even if they can be installed on the vehicle at all.
	- If there is an installed item you can select it in the shown menu, then you will be the given a confirmation option to remove it. Doing so will set it back to stock and place the specific upgrade in your inventory.
- At the bottom of this menu is a quick shortcut to what is displayed by the `/checkmods` command, which displays a simple list of all possible cosmetic mods that can applied to the current vehicle

------------------
## Mechanic_Tools / repair.lua

- This menu is activated by the item "mechanic_tools"
- Note: It tires to get all the information BEFORE the progressbars so if you don't get any animations, theres an error.
- It will start with an animated check of the engine and body for damage and then get a list what it found.
- How this menu fucntions is defined by the config options
	- `FreeRepair = true` will allow you to repair the car with no requirements
	- `StashRepair = true` will place a stash location for the mechanics to place their materials so they can be pulled from there and used when repairing
	- The locations for these mechanic stashes are set at the top of the file, the default is set to Gabz Tuners.
- When `qb-mechanicjob` is detected, it automatically attempts to load extra damages from this script
	- If you don't use it, only Engine and Body will be available to repair

------------------
## Nitrous / nos.lua

- Nitrous relies on three columns in the database `player_vehicles`
	- `hasnitro` - Wether the vehicle has Nitrous in or not
	- `noslevel` - The amount of nos that is in the vehicle (max 100)
	- `noscolour` - The RGB colours of the NOS Purge
- A vehicle's NOS is saved between server restarts for player owned vehicles
- To add NOS to a vehicle you will first need `Turbo` to be installed on the vehicle.
	- Then you will need a NOS cannister (`nos`) and to use it outside of the vehicle. This will start a skill check to install it.
- The NOS consists of two modes, these can be switched with `Left Ctrl`
	- Boost Mode
	- Purge Mode
- When in Boost Mode you can control the power with `Page Down` or `Page Up` and is activated with `Left Shift`
	- Level 1 - Standard NOS Boost
	- Level 2 - Increased acceleration + Boost
	- Level 3 - Greater acceleration + Boost
	- Boosting for too long will damage the engine and the greater the boost level the more damage that will be done
- When in Purge Mode, you will be able to activate purge spray's from your vehicle
	- `Page Down` or `Page Up` in this mode controls the the of spray (purely cosmetic)
	- Purging after boosting speeds up the cooldown and allows you to boost again sooner
- When the NOS is used up in a vehicle, the driver will receive an empty nos can, which can be refilled/crafted to make it full again.
- If you put in a new can before you run out of NOS in the vehicle you will also recieve an empty can.
- NOS can be installed on almost any vehicle
	- If it allows you to install `Turbo` you can install NOS
- The `manualPurgeLoc` table at the bottom of the file is the Manually placed Purge locations on vehicles
	- Currently I added Super cars beacuse their default placement was all over the place
	- Feel free to edit/add any and share these with others.
```
{ xOffset, yOffset, zOffset, xRotation, yRotation, zRotation },
```
------------------
## manualrepair.lua / Non-Mechanic repair benches

- This file creates repair benches that can **ONLY** be used when there isn't any mechanics on duty.
 + To add/move a manual repair bench head to the bottom of the locations.lua [example here](https://github.com/jimathy/jim-mechanicguide#locationslua)
- The benches are added to set locations at the top of this file
- They are activated by targetting with `qb-target` while in a car
- How the config.lua options are set will determine how the menu functions
	- `Config.ManualRepairCost` - This is the **SET** amount a vehicle repair will cost
	- `Config.ManualRepairBased` - when `true` this overrides the above and grabs the value of the vehicle from vehicles.lua
	- `Config.ManualRepairPercent` - The percentage of the vehicle value to be used. Default is `5`
	- `Config.repairEngine` - `true` repair engine + body, `false` repair body only
	- `Config.repairExtras` - `true` will attempt to repair extra damages from `qb-mechanicjob`
	- `Config.dutyMessage` - The excuse for why people can't repair while mechanics are on duty.
	- `Config.repairAnimate` - Animates the repair, better than a progress bar
	- `Config.repairSpeed` - How fast each repair step takes

------------------
## police.lua / Emergency Repair Benches

- This file creates repair/customisation benches for police
	- These are intended to be for Police/EMS players, but other job roles can be added easily
- It adds a bench to the set locations where they can repair and change a handful of cosmetics/extras.
- This is activated by using third eye/qb-target
- Note: I have been asked several times to add more options to this
	- There are so many different custom police cars that use a random modification to change a small thing on the vehicle.
	- At that point if I added more/all options it would just be another version of `qb-customs`

------------------
## preview.lua - `/preview`

- The preview system is shown by typing `/preview`
	- This system locks the vehicle in place
	- Shows a menu with all possible cosmetic changes for the current vehicle
	- You can close the menu to move the camera around
	- Typing `/preview` opens it again allowing you to continue
	- When complete, exit the vehicle and the preview will be classed as finished
- When exiting the vehicle, depending on the set config options you will recieve a list of the changes made
	- `Config.DiscordPreview` will attempt to print the list to a specified discord channel
	- `Config.PreviewPhone = true` will attempt to use the set phone system to send the player a phone email with the list
	- `Config.PreviewPhone = false` will spawn a item `mechboard` which when used will show the list of changes on screen
- Note: Spawning the `mechboard` item, trying to use it and then asking me why it's telling you not to spawn it shows you haven't read this-

#### To create a discord webhook follow the following steps:
- Click the gear icon (Edit Channel) of the channel you want to post to.
- Click Webhooks in the left menu.
- Click the Create Webhook button.
- Enter a Name of your choice.
- Click the Copy button of the Webhook URL.
- Click the Save button.
- Paste the Webhook URL in the script you want to use it.

-----------------
## Configuration - config.lua

There is little snippets of information on each line for these, but this is a more detailed list of information

### Config.Lan
- This script has a built in locale system, it fairly updated versions, but the most recent versions of each language will be at: https://github.com/jimathy/mechanic-locales
- You will need to then set the langauge with Config.Lan. By default it's set to english `"en"`

### Config.Debug
- This enables a debug mode, this will enable the debug boxes around locations to show you where they are set and where they are moving to.
- This also enables Debug Messages in the F8 Menu and server console to help me and you with debugging issues

### Config.img
- Use this if if you are using an older/edited version of qb-menu
- This is for adding images of inventory items to qb-menu and qb-input.
- The default would be: `qb-inventory/html/images/`
- I personally use LJ's inventory system which makes it: `lj-inventory/html/images/`. I imagine other's are pretty similar.

### Config.JimShops
- Set this to true if you are using my free qb-shops alternative, [jim-shops](https://github.com/jimathy/jim-shops)
- Set to false to use default inventory style shops

### Config.JimMenu
- Set this to true if you have an updated qb-menu with inventory icon/fontawesome support
- This clear's `Config.img` so you don't get duplicate images

### Config.distkph
- This is only used when the odometer is used, toolbox menu and the onscreen milage display.
	- `true` = distance in Kilometers
	- `false` = distance in Miles

### Config.Notify
- This controls which notification system is to be called

### Config.isVehicleOwned
- This checks the `player_vehicles` database for if the vehicle is player owned or not.
- If you only want customisations to be made to player owned vehicles, enable this.

### Config.RequiresJob
- This locks the mechanics performance items and cosmetic items behind a job role.
- The jobs are set lower in the config.lua file at `Config.JobRoles`

### Config.LocationBlips
- This enables your locations blips even if you disable location requirements

### Config.LocationRequired
- This makes it so items become location locked. You will only be able to work if you are in a polyzone for a job's location (items will only work in a set mechanic shop)
- If this is disabled items can be used anywhere.

### Config.CostmeticJob
- This enables or disables a job requirement on cosmetic items.
- This ignores `Config.RequiresJob`

### Config.FreeRepair
- Enabling this makes all repairs by mechanic not require any materials to repair, so they repairs are free.

### Config.StashRepair
- This enables grabbing materials for repairs from their current jobs mechanics stash, these stashes are accessible at set loications in the locations.lua.
- If disabled materials will be taken from the players inventory.

### Config.Stores
- This enables or completely disables the creation of shops for items.
- If you want your mechanics to be able to either buy or get the items for free quickly, enable this.

### Config.StashCraft
- This enables grabbing materials for crafting from their current jobs mechanics stash, these stashes are accessible at set loications in the locations.lua.
- If disabled materials will be taken from the players inventory.

### Config.Crafting
- This enables or completely disables the creation of crafting locations for items.
- If you want your mechanics to build and craft each item from ingredients, enable this.

### Config.PreviewPhone
- Enabling this will make the changed cosmetics from `/preview` be collected into an email and be sent to the person who did the preview
- Disabling this will make the list of changed costmetics and put it on a new "mechboard" item which is given to the person who did the preview

### Config.PreviewJob
- Enabling this locks the `/preview` command behind job roles
- The jobs are set lower in the config.lua file at `Config.JobRoles`

### Config.PreviewLocation
- Enable this if you want to lock the `/preview` command to only work in mechanic shops

### Config.PhoneMail
- This is used to determine your which phone script you use to send an email with preview details to your players
- This is only used if `Config.PreviewPhone` is true
- This currently as of writing this only supports `qb-phone` and `gks-phone`

### Config.CosmeticRemoval
- This simply, when enabled, will remove the cosmetic items (listed above) from your inventory when successfully added to the vehicle
- Disabling make them unlimited use

### Config.ShowOdo
- Enabling this will by default show the on-screen Odometer(Miles/Kilometers) when driving in an owned vehicle.
- Players can toggle on and off theirselves easily with the command `/showodo`

### Config.OdoLocation
- This determines where the location of the Odometer will be for your players
- List of possible options:
```
	"left"
	"right"
	"top"
	"top-left"
	"top-right"
	"bottom"
	"bottom-left"
	"bottom-right"
```
### Config.OdoShowIcons
- As of v2.9 there is now a "dashboard" feature that shows icons representing the damage
- Toggling this enables or completely disables these

### Config.OdoAlwaysShowIcons
- Enable this to show the icons ALL THE TIM, even when parts are not damaged

### Config.OdoIconsToShow
- Fine control over which icons will show
- Setting any of these to false will make the icon never be shown

### Config.Chameleon
- Enabling this enables the chameleon paint features, this requires the files to be installed correctly, disabling this will hide all references to it

### Config.WaxFeatures = true
- This enables the ability to apply "Wax" to a car, making them stay clean for set amounts of time

### Config.ManualRepairCost
- This is the amount to charge people for a repair at the manual repair benches.
- The default is `5000` but I recommend setting this to a high amount for your server
- The intention of the mechanic script is to provide RP to the server, there is no RP in using a prop instead of talking to someone.

### Config.ManualRepairCostBased
- Set this to true if you want the cost to ALWAYS be the amount set at "ManualRepairCost"
- Set this to false if you want it to "ManualRepairCost" to be the max and cost is calculated by damage

### Config.ManualRepairBased
- This overrides the previous setting `ManualRepairCost`
- Setting this to true sets the price of the repair to be based on the cost of the vehicle in your vehicles.lua

### Config.ManualRepairPercent
- This is only used if `ManualRepairBased` is enabled.
- This needs to be set to the percentage of the value of the vehicle you want to charge people per repair
- For example:
	- 5% of a $10,000 car would be $500 per repair
	- 10% of a $200,000 car would be $20,000 per repair

### Config.repairEngine
- When enabled this will include engine repairs in the Repair Bench process
- If disabled it will only attempt to repair the body

### Config.repairExtras
- Enabling this will include Extra Damages repair that come from `qb-mechanicjob`
- if `qb-mechanicjob` is not found but this is true, it will skip over these extras

### Config.dutyMessage
- I left his here as people were giving me different reasons for why they wanted the repair benches in the script
- I'm leaving this up to them for how they want to phrase their notification.
- Default: `"There is a Mechanic on duty!"`

### Config.repairAnimate
- When `true` this will add a small animatied sequence to the repair of the vehicle, instead of people just sitting and watching a progressbar

### Config.repairSpeed
- The time between each task while using repairAnimate. `1500` Seems to be a reasonable time for each one

### Config.NosRefillCharge
- This only is used at NOS Refill stations, if you have added them to your locations in locations.lua
- The amount in dollars required for a player to refill an Empty NOS can.
- Note: There is also the option of a mechanic crafting them for you.
- The default is `1000`

### Config.NosTopSpeed
- Controls the top speed "multiplier" when boosting
- Functions a bit weirdly - 55.0 isn't 55 times normal speed, but seems a good boost value
- Default - `55.0`
- This seems to be a fair number but people have said that in their servers this number is too powerful and needed to be lowered
- Removing this config option or setting this to `-1.0` disables it and leaves the accelleration boost on.

### Config.NosBoostPower
- Fine controls over the accelleration power for each boost level
- Shown as a table for optimization
```lua
NosBoostPower = {
	10.0, -- Level 1
	30.0, -- Level 2
	50.0, -- Level 3
},
```
- These values seem a good default, but may need adjusting if you have customised vehicle meta files

### Config.NitrousUseRate
- This is how fast the nitrous drains
- Default - `0.4`
- Boost Level 1 changes this number minus half of this number (0.4 - (0.4 / 2))
- Boost Level 3 changes this number plus half of this number (0.4 + (0.4 / 2))

### Config.NitrousCoolDown
- This is how long a player has to wait before the boost works again
- Default - `7`
- 7 seconds seems to be enough time for it to cooldown, setting this too low allows some servers players to travel at insane speeds after spamming the button
- Set to `0` to disable this

### Config.CooldownConfirm
- Simply, this will play a confirmation beep when cooldown is complete
- Made is toggleable in the config in case people didn't like it

### Config.nosDamage
- This enables NOS causing damage to engine while boosting
- Boosting for too long will play sound alerts and damage the Engine.

### Config.boostExplode
- If boosting too long at Boost Level 3 the NOS tank will explode.
- Will cause damage to the vehicle and cause a fire.
- This will remove remaining NOS from the vehicle and not give an empty tank

### Config.EnableFlame
- `true` adds exhaut flame effects while boosting
### Config.EnableTrails
- `true` adds taillight effects while boosting
### Config.EnableScreen
- `true` True adds screen effects while boosting

### Config.skillcheck
- When adding Nos to a vehicle there are three skillcheck script options available
	- "qb-skillbar"
	- "qb-lock"
	- "ps-ui"

### Config.explosiveFail
- When `true` there is a `1 in 10` chance for when you fail the skillcheck for the tank to explode in the vehicle.
- Doesn't cause much damage, but fill push the player and vehicle back

### Config.explosiveFailJob
- When `false` mecahnics WILL **NOT** cause explosions on failing the skill check
- When `true` mechanics **CAN** cause explosions on failing the skill check

### Config.DiscordPreview
- This enables or disables the Discord Reports for the `/preview` command
- When `true` this system will send the report to a specified discord channel using a webhook
- When `false` this system will be ignored/disabled

### Config.DiscordDefault
- So people seem to be confused by this one.
- This is the default channel that will be used, no matter where you are.
- If you haven't set specific discord channels in a location, it **should** "default" to this link.

### Config.DiscordColour
- You don't need to touch this, but this is the default colour of the post in the discord channel
- The default colour is `16753920` - this is a "decimal" colour number, which is a yellow colour.


### Repair requirements
- These are the repair costs and materials that are needed
- Each one has to have **1** set item
- The cost for each is a MAX amount, eg. 100% damage would be this number, 50% would be half this number.
- The defaults:
```
RepairEngine = "iron",
RepairEngineCost = 8,
--
RepairBody = "plastic",
RepairBodyCost = 8,
--
RepairRadiator = "newoil",
RepairRadiatorCost = 1,
--
RepairAxle = "axleparts",
RepairAxleCost = 1,
--
RepairBrakes = "sparkplugs",
RepairBrakesCost = 1,
--
RepairClutch = "carbattery",
RepairClutchCost = 1,
--
RepairFuel = "plastic",
RepairFuelCost = 8,
```

### Duct tape:
- Many people forgot these are a thing while begging me to add repair benches..
- The Ducttape item is intended to be an alternative and customisable version of repairkits
- They are customisable and let even set the max amount of how much the parts get repaired

### Config.DuctSimpleMode
- This sets the duct tape item into simple mode, repairing to the amount every time
- `true` makes duct tape set every use to the amount set below at `MaxDuctEngine`
- `false` uses the `DuctAmountEngine` value to repair the by vehicle each use

### Config.MaxDuctEngine
- This is the MAX value the engine can be repaired by, leave this below 1000(100%) so people still need to use mechanic's
- If `DuctSimpleMode` is `true` will set it straight to this amount
- If `DuctSimpleMode` is `false` it will be the max amount it can be repaired to
- Default = `450.0` - (45% health)

### Config.DuctAmountEngine
- The amount to repair your engine by each ducttape item use
- This is only used if `DuctSimpleMode` is `false`
- Default = `100.0` - (10% Health)

### Config.DuctTapeBody
- Setting this to `true` allows the body to be repaired along side the engine
- This is also affected by `DuctSimpleMode` in the same ways

### Config.MaxDuctBody
- This is the MAX value the body can be repaired by, leave this below 1000(100%) so people still need to use mechanic's
- If `DuctSimpleMode` is `true` will set it straight to this amount
- If `DuctSimpleMode` is `false` it will be the max amount it can be repaired to
- Default = `450.0` - (45% health)

### Config.DuctAmountBody
- The amount to repair your engine by each ducttape item use
- This is only used if `DuctSimpleMode` is `false`
- Default = `100.0` - (10% Health)

### Config.RemoveDuctTape
- Simply, if this is `true` it will remove 1 ducttape item after use
- If `false` it will be constantly reusable

### Config.Jobroles:
- This only matters if Config.RequiresJob is enabled and is specifcally for the ability to use the mecahnic items and use `/preview` command
- These are the job roles that you want to be able to use the items in this script
- Example layout for multiple job roles: `JobRoles = { "mechanic", "tuner" }`
- The defualt setting is = `{ "mechanic" }`

### Config.nosBarColour
- When set to true it will create a "progressbar" for a value in colour
	- <span style='color:green'>▓</span><span style='color:yellow'>▓</span><span style='color:red'>▓</span><span style='color:grey'>░</span>
- when set to false it will leave the bars as white and grey
	- <span style='color:white'>▓</span><span style='color:grey'>░</span>

### Config.nosBarFull
- This is the symbol used to indicate a full segment in the bar
	- Default = `▓`

### Config.nosBarEmpty
- This is the symbol used to indicate an empty segment in the bar
	- Default = `░`

------------------
## Locations.lua

- This is one of the most important files in the script
	- It holds all the locations for going on duty, where people can apply mods etc.
- I have tried to include as many default mechanic shops as possible (All Gabz MLO's supported)
- These are easy to edit, change or remove, make a new polyzone using the commands
	1. `/pzcreate poly`
	2. `/pzadd`
	3. `/pzfinish`
- The main building's polyzones are made use of when `Config.LocationRequired = true` enabling this makes it so mechanic items can only used these zones.
- If you have `Config.RequiresJob = false` then anyone can use the items in this location, setting this config option to `true` makes it so mechanic workers are the only ones who can use them.

### Explanation of the locations and how to make one

```
### Explanation of each part of the location snippet
- `job`
	- The job that will work in this building
- `autoClockout`
	- Take employees off duty when leaving the polyzone if they were working in this location
- `zones`
	- This is a batch of vector2 locations (usually corners of a building) to create a polyzone
- `stash`
	- Where the job stashes will be accessible
	- Only appears if `Config.stashCraft` or `Config.stashRepair` are `true`
- `store` - Where the job lock stores will be accessible
	- These stores are set in the recipes.lua
	- By default the items are priced at $0 (free)
- `crafting`
	- Where the crafting stations will be accessible
- `clockin`
	- Where the player can go on duty
- `nosrefill`
	- Where the non-mechanic nos refill station will be
- `garage` - The "job garage" system that spawns a fresh temporary car
	- `spawn` - The vector4 location and direction where the spawned vehicle will appear
	- `out` - The vector4 location and direction of the "parking meter" prop used to access the spawn menu
	- `list` - The list of vehicle spawn codes that will appear in the garage's menu
- `payments`
	- Location, heading, and job's logo used for access payment scripts (default: [jim-payments](https://github.com/jimathy/jim-payments))
- `blip`
	- Where the map maker of the building will appear
- `bliplabel`
	- The name of the job/building that will appear on the map
- `blipcolor`
	- The colour id of the map marker
- `discordlink`
	- The webhook of the channel where this locations `/preview` reports are sent
	- This can be set per location, all you need to do is grab a webhook from a discord channel and then paste it here
	- This can be used in any discord, for example a players job discord's channel
	- If the locations link isn't set or left as `""` it will use the link set at `Config.DiscordDefault` instead, if available
- `discordcolour`
	- This is the colour of the post for the discord channel, this is a "decimal" colour number

### Creating a new polyzone location:
- This is simple guide for making new locations
	- Creating a "Zone"
		- Start by standing new a corner of a new building
		- Type in your chat `/pzcreate zone` and this will bring up a box to name it, type whatever you want to help find it later
		- You can move the created point with your `arrow keys`
		- When this point is placed placed type `/pzadd` to create a new point
		- You can again move this location with your `arrow keys`
		- Repeat this until finished
		- Type `/pzfinish` to finsh creating the zone and save the information to a file
		- The file is located in your server folder next to your `server.cfg`
	- Creating a "Box"
		- Start by standing near the zone you wish to create
		- Type in your chat `/pzcreate box` and this will bring up a box to name it
		- It will then ask you the width and length of the box, a good default is 0.6 and 0.6
		- Holding `Shift` or `Alt` while using the scroll wheel will allow you to change these values
		- Pressing `Z` will swap to being able to move the box up and down and changing the box height
		- Holding `Ctrl` while doing any of this will make it move slower for precise handling
		- Type `/pzfinish` to finsh creating the box and save the information to a file
		- The file is located in your server folder next to your `server.cfg`

------------------
## recipes.lua

## Crafting
- Crafting can be enabled/disabled in `config.lua` with the setting `Config.Crafting`
- Crafting is accessed through locations created by `locations.lua`
- The menu's are shared between all jobs/locations but you can lock items to specific jobs and grades
- And example of a recipe snippet
```lua
--This example is purely an example
{ 	['cleaningkit'] = {		--The item that will be crafted
		['rubber'] = 1,
		["engine2"] = 1,	--An ingredient and the amount needed
		['plastic'] = 1,
	},
	["amount"] = 2,		-- The amount that of the crafted item you will recieve
	["job"] = {			-- Support for hiding items only to certain jobs (multiple possible)
		["mechanic"] = 4,	-- Job: "mechanic" and Grade "4" only and above can see this recipe
		["tuner"] = 4,	-- Job: "tuner" and Grade "4" only and above can see this recipe
	}
},
```
- Where the ingredients come from depends on the `config.lua` settings
	- `StashCraft = true` would demand the ingredients come from the current job roles stash
	- `StashCraft = false` would instead check the players inventory for the ingredient items

## Stores
- Stores can be enabled/disabled in `config.lua` with the setting `Config.Stores`
- There are built in job stores that allow quick access of items
	- By default the items are free, but you can change this easily
- Example of a store snippet entry:
```lua
{
	name = "mechanic_tools", -- Item's spawn code
	price = 0,	-- Cost of the item
	amount = 10,	-- How many are available to buy
	info = {},	-- Usually blank, none of my items use this
	type = "item", -- Usually left as "item"
	requiredJob = { 	-- Job lock for items (THIS ONLY WORKS WITH JIM-SHOPS)
		["mechanic"] = 1,	-- Mechanic grade 1 and higher can see/buy this item
		["tuner"] = 1, 	-- Tuner grade 1 and higher can see/buy this item
	}
},
```

## Installation Notes

### Add the script to the server resources
- I highly recommend putting the `jim-mechanic` folder in a new folder called `[jim]`
- Then add `ensure [jim]` AFTER your other scripts in your server.cfg


### Item installation
- Add the image files from the zip to your `qb-inventory > html > images` folder
- Add these lines to your qb-core > shared lua under the Items section

## Dependancies
- This script requires `qb-menu` and `qb-input` for the menu systems
- This script requires `qb-target` for opening stores, crafting tables, cash registers, going on duty, nos refill
- This script is also designed to use [jim-payments](https://github.com/jimathy/jim-payments) for charging customers and sending money to the society accounts

## NOS + Odometer
- There are expanded features included in this scripts with SQL
- The included `vehaddon.sql` file needs to be imported into your player_vehicles database to add the appropriate columns (traveldistance, hasnitro, noslevel)
- The `hasnitro` and `noslevel` columns being added enables the of saving Nitrous levels through server restarts
- The `traveldistance` column adds an Odometer to the toolbox/mechanic_tools menus, this this can retrieved in miles or kilometers.


## "mechboard" item
- **This isn't fully required but helps organise multiples of the "mechboard"**
- The MechBoard item is an item given to the person who uses the preview menu and makes changes
- To make full use of this item you need to add the ability for the item to show item info in your inventory system
- I have only done this with `qb-inventory` and `lj-inventory` as they are similar
	- `qb-inventory/html/js/app.js`

- Search for "harness" or Scroll down until you find:
```js
} else if (itemData.name == "harness") {
	$(".item-info-title").html("<p>" + itemData.label + "</p>");
	$(".item-info-description").html(
		"<p>" + itemData.info.uses + " uses left.</p>"
	);
```
- Directly underneath this add:
```js
} else if (itemData.name == "mechboard") {
	$(".item-info-title").html("<p>" + itemData.label + "</p>");
	$(".item-info-description").html(
		"<p>" + itemData.info.vehplate + "</p>" +
		"<p>" + itemData.info.veh + "</p>"
	);
```
- When successfully added the mechboards will show the vehicle and plate number

## Updating core events
- To add the ability to save RGB paints, their colour finishes and drift/bulletproof tires you need to change two functions in your qb-core/client/functions.lua
- Replace `GetVehicleProperties` and `SetVehicleProperties` functions with these:
```lua

## QB-MechanicJob
- **You don't NEED qb-mechaicjob to use Jim-Mechanic but doing so grants extra features**
- Extra damages will be enabled by default if you use `qb-mechanicjob` and `qb-vehiclefailure`
- If you **DON'T** want to use `qb-mechanicjob` but want to keep `qb-vehiclefailure`
- REPLACE this event (DON'T REMOVE) in qb-vehiclefailure > client.lua.
- This will make it only work if qb-mechanicjob is started.

```lua
-- Functions
local function DamageRandomComponent()

	if GetResourceState('qb-mechanicjob') ~= "started" then return end

    local dmgFctr = math.random() + math.random(0, 2)
    local randomComponent = DamageComponents[math.random(1, #DamageComponents)]
    local randomDamage = (math.random() + math.random(0, 1)) * dmgFctr
    exports['qb-mechanicjob']:SetVehicleStatus(QBCore.Functions.GetPlate(vehicle), randomComponent, exports['qb-mechanicjob']:GetVehicleStatus(QBCore.Functions.GetPlate(vehicle), randomComponent) - randomDamage)
end
```
## QB-MechanicJob Optimization
- I recently realised that `qb-mechanicjob` by default has a seemingly currently unnecessary database change, every 2 seconds of driving a vehicle.
	- Some servers have over 100 people in. If all players are in cars at the same time that would be 100 database changes every 2 seconds.
- Long explanation is that the distance travelled is set to `0` on script/server starts
	- As you drive your car it updates the distance travelled.
	- This is then used to calculate damages and other things.
	- This is saved server side but also updates the database with the numbers.
	- This isn't needed to be saved as it is saved server side already and never calls it FROM the database and is just a waste and laggy
- **TLDR**: `qb-mechanicjob` has a useless database check that can cause lag for servers with lots of players
```lua
-- Go to qb-mechanicjob server/main.lua and find:
RegisterNetEvent('qb-vehicletuning:server:UpdateDrivingDistance', function(amount, plate)

-- Remove or comment out:
local result = MySQL.Sync.fetchAll('SELECT plate FROM player_vehicles WHERE plate = ?', {plate})
if result[1] ~= nil then
    MySQL.Async.execute('UPDATE player_vehicles SET drivingdistance = ? WHERE plate = ?', {amount, plate})
end
```
- It will work exactly the same way but no extra database lag

## Blue Nos Flames / Nopixel Style
- [Download the FiveM version of this file](https://www.gta5-mods.com/misc/purple-blue-flames-replace-sp-fivem)
- UnZip the file
- Copy the `stream` folder into the `jim-mechanic` folder (next to the fxmanifest.lua)
- That's it! The effects are show while boosting and the different styles change between boost levels
- Restart the script. Done.

## Support for CodeM-Hud
- Had a few people asking about CodeM hud support for NOS
- I assume their HUD's are similar and this will work for most
- Simply add this line at the bottom of the HUD scripts nitro.lua
```lua
RegisterNetEvent("hud:client:UpdateNitrous", function(hasnitro, level, show) SendNUIMessage({ type="set_status", statustype = "nitro", value = (level or 0)}) end)
```
- This will make `jim-mechanic` trigger the HUD's NOS level changes
